# Portfolio Project

This is my portfolio project I started working on in the beginning af my Frontend Developer journey. It was written in Vanilla JavaScript and CSS but I decided to rewrite it using TypeScript, Vite, and Sass. The project is a single-page application that showcases my personal portfolio, including my skills, experience, and projects.
